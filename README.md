Egoshots dataset and Semantic Fidelity metric
=====
This repo contains code for our paper "Egoshots, an ego-vision life-logging dataset and semantic fidelity metric to evaluate diversity in image captioning models" accepted at ICLR-2020, MACHINE LEARNING IN REAL LIFE (ML-IRL) workshop.
## Dataset
Egoshots consists of real-life ego-vision images captioned using state of the art image captioning models, and aims at evaluating the robustness, diversity, and sensitivity of these models, as well as providing a real life-logging setting on-the-wild dataset that can aid the task of evaluating real settings. It consists of images from two computer science interns
for 1 month each. Dataset can be downloaded from the given link.
